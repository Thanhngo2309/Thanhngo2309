              <p><span class="first-letter">N</span>o one alive today witnessed the invention of the printing press, telegraph, and telephone — monumental technologies that reshaped communication. In the last century, few innovations have reached such transformative heights. Against this backdrop, Apple Vision Pro stands out as a unique, integrated hardware and software experience that might just survive the test of time.</p>
              <p>I know — the $3,499 price tag on Apple Vision Pro is painfully expensive and will be out of the reach of most consumers, despite how cool and useful it might be. Even though I can’t stop using it after a week, it’s not yet a “got to have it” product for everyone, in the footsteps of an Apple iPhone and iPad. However, the product provides a vital, though early, glimpse of what the future will look like. That vision could take a decade or more to become mainstream, but measured against that statement, Apple Vision Pro is a triumph.</p>

            <p class="v2101_22022">
              <p>Having used Vision Pro for about a week as of this writing, my mind is overflowing with various viewpoints. While some of my analyst colleagues might disagree, I’ve tended to take an optimistic position on Vision Pro’s appeal.</p>
              <p>Plainly stated, Vision Pro is Apple’s first device for spatial computing. Apple coined “spatial computing” as a marketing slogan when it announced Vision Pro last June, and it’s now become clear to me why after spending some significant time with it.</p>

            <span class="v2101_22025">
              <p>Interestingly, although wearing the Vision Pro provides a stunning perspective, users will always notice that a room is brighter when you remove it. The immersive settings I used because of the low light levels in my office sometimes made everything look murky. I found that good lighting remedied this situation. Therefore, many Vision Pro users might reconsider the existing ambient lighting in their home offices if they plan on using the product regularly.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the displays you’re viewing still don’t fill the headset, leaving you with a black border around your field of view and without peripheral vision. Currently, no headset can replicate full peripheral vision due to technological limitations.</p>

            <span class="v2101_22032">
              <p>Right now, there is only one laptop I know of that has been enabled for AI, though that will change in a few months. That is Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Studio 2, and it has a built-in NPU (neural processing unit), something that will be in most mid- to high-end laptops by the end of next year but currently is only in this oneApple Vision Pro’s processing power allows it to run powerful applications. There is minimal chance that M2 will become a ceiling for most apps in the near future because visionOS developers have been creating native apps or porting iPad app experiences.</p>
              <p>The computing environment would have been even more complicated and unpredictable if Apple had permitted Vision Pro to run Mac software. So, Apple has wisely restricted Vision Pro to run most iOS and iPadOS apps, which has significant battery life and performance advantages.</p>

            <span class="v2101_22038">
            <p>Rumors abound that Apple reportedly plans to wait until 2026 to release the Apple Vision Pro 2 or a non-Pro version. That’s probably not a big issue for an inaugural release of a significant platform.</p>
              
            <p>Still, it is a long time to be limited to the M2 processor, particularly when considering more heavyweight apps that get developed and come to fruition. Developers never shy away from more performance power, and I don’t think Vision Pro will be exempt from that reality.</p>
