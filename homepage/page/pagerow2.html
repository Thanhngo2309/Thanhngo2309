              <p>Website impersonation scams have become a growing problem, although many businesses aren’t happy with the tools they have to address them.</p>
              <p>A study released Tuesday by digital risk protection solutions company Memcyco found that nearly three-quarters of businesses have deployed a digital impersonation protection solution to avert online scams, but only 6% of those organizations are satisfied that it protects them and their customers. “That’s really shocking,” Memcyco CMO Eran Tsur told TechNewsWorld.</p>
              <p>According to the study, more than two-thirds of businesses (68%) know their websites are being impersonated, and almost half (44%) know this directly impacts their customers. The study is based on a survey of 200 full-time director-to-C-level employees in the security, fraud, digital, and web industries in the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
              <p>“A spoofed website can lead to significant financial losses for customers if they are tricked into providing login credentials or sensitive personal information,” said Matthew Corwin, managing director of Guidepost Solutions, a global security, compliance, and investigations firm.</p>

            <span class="v2101_22021">Leaning on Customer Reports for Detection</span>
            <p class="v2101_22022">
              <p>The study also found that the most common way two-thirds (66%) of the surveyed companies became aware of website impersonation attacks was through incident reports from affected customers. “That’s unbelievable,” Tsur said. “Not only are the deployed solutions not protecting against or preventing these attacks, the organizations don’t have a clue whether these attacks have taken place or not.”</p>
              <p>Guidepost Solutions’ Corwin noted that businesses that depend primarily on customer reports to detect impersonation scams might miss out on crucial early warnings and the opportunity to defend against emerging threats proactively. “A reactive approach puts the burden on customers, which can damage customer relationships and trust,” he said.</p>
              <p>“Learning about scams from customers means the attack has already impacted individuals, causing harm before mitigation even begins,” added Approov’s Miracco. “Regular scans are the only alternative that might take down fake websites that mimic a brand, but this is challenging, as you have to anticipate events before they occur.”</p>
              <p>“Working from customer reports is a reactive approach, not a proactive one,” he said. I’m not sure an adequate defense exists yet, so users need to be educated and more careful before responding to emails that look legitimate.”</p>

            <span class="v2101_22025">
              <p>Corwin explained that the accessibility of AI-driven tools and pre-packaged phish kits means even less technically skilled individuals can execute convincing impersonation attacks. “AI-enhanced phishing tools can mimic legitimate websites more accurately, deceiving even the most vigilant users and amplifying the threat landscape,” he said.</p>
              <p>“Often,” he continued, “cybercriminals will also leverage domain names that appear nearly the same as the legitimate address of a company or brand but contain slight variations or errors, known as ‘combosquatting’ or ‘typosquatting.'”</p>
              <p>“AI is very dangerous,” added Miracco. “These tools are so easy to use, even for individuals with no technical skills, allowing virtually anyone to create sophisticated phishing campaigns. It’s our worst cybersecurity nightmare come true — hand-delivered by companies that talk about how wonderful AI will be. Sadly, the early adopters of most technologies are bad actors.”</p>

            <span class="v2101_22032">
              <p>Roger Grimes, a defense evangelist for KnowBe4, a security awareness training provider in Clearwater, Fla., recommended that every company sending emails implement DMARC, SPF, and DKIM, which are global anti-phishing standards. “They attempt to defeat malicious emails and links claiming to be from the legitimate sending domain,” he told TechNewsWorld.</p>
              <p>“For example,” he explained, “If I get an email claiming to be from Microsoft, the receiver’s email server/client can use DMARC, SPF, and DKIM to see if the email actually originated from Microsoft.”</p>
              <p>Miracco recommended that company websites ensure all web traffic is encrypted with SSL/TLS certificates to make it harder for attackers to intercept and spoof communications.</p>
              <p>He added that mobile applications should implement attestation mechanisms to verify their integrity and ensure that interactions with backend APIs only originate from legitimate, unaltered instances of the app. They should also hire threat intelligence services that can monitor for phishing kits, fake domains, and other indicators of impersonation.</p>
