            <span class="v2101_22019">
                <p><span class="first-letter">I</span>participated in a podcast last week. One of the other panelists was Moses Ma from FutureLab. FutureLab has a project called Manhattan 2, referencing the Manhattan Project for nuclear bomb development. However, this project is focused on helping, not killing people, and on the need to develop a human-centric approach to AI deployment that assures people have productive lives rather than being homeless and unemployable, which is, sadly, the path we are on currently.</p>
                
                <p>Let’s discuss how we could have a better post-AI future this week. We’ll close with my Product of the Week, the impressive new iPad Pro, which is, by a significant margin, the best tablet in the market right now.</p>

            <span class="v2101_22021">The AI-Jobs Problem</span>
            
            <span class="v2101_22022">
              <p>Every Industrial Revolution has created concerns about lost jobs, and those concerns have abated with the jobs created by the recent technology, which worked out well eventually. I say eventually because there have been a lot of issues with the transitions, particularly with older workers who may lack the time or interest to be retrained, often leading to spikes in unemployment.</p>
              <p>But this latest AI Industrial Revolution is hugely different because we aren’t automating a process so much as we are creating technology to replace individual people. Devin is a case in point. It is an AI employee that is on the market to fill an actual job. Rather than hire a human, you can just buy Devin.</p>
              <p>AI and robots are not just being created to fill new jobs. They are being made to fill jobs where there are shortages. Long-haul drivers, for instance, who are in very short supply, are being supplemented and potentially replaced by self-driving trucks.</p>

          <div class="v2101_22023">
            <span class="v2101_22024">FutureLab’s Manhattan 2 Project</span>
            <span class="v2101_22025">
              <p>Manhattan 2 is a fascinating project that outlines a plan to ensure future AI development and deployment that enhances employees and minimizes displacement at scale.

                What seems to set this project apart is that the plan puts employees, not AIs, at the center of the effort. Most AI deployments just focus on the AI part; if it displaces people, well, that is just a side effect that is, unfortunately, way too common.</p>
              <p>The new jobs will be AI-related, so people will need to improve their AI skills quickly. It will be similar to learning a new language or musical instrument. For instance, I’ve wanted to learn how to play the piano but have been unwilling to put in the effort, and I expect there are many folks out there like me. We’ll talk about making the learning process easier in a moment.</p>

            <span class="v2101_22032">
              <p>Level Ex is one of the most interesting training programs I’ve seen. Imagine learning a skill from a video game. In fact, imagine if most of your applied education was in video games, and imagine if the knowledge behind the video game could be used to train people and AIs.</p>
              <p>What Level Ex has been doing is mainly focused on doctors. It uses games that allow doctors to pick up specialties in two hours, knowledge that normally takes one or two years to master. It was developed for the Mars mission because they realized that if someone were injured, they couldn’t ship a hospital and entire staff to Mars, and getting help remotely from Earth would be difficult due to latency and data rate issues.</p>
              <p>Instead of traditional book and lecture methods, employees are learning through video games. This approach not only demonstrates skills but also allows them to be practiced in simulations.</p>

          <div class="v2101_22036">
            <span class="v2101_22037">Wrapping Up: A Better Future</span>
            <span class="v2101_22038">
              <p>We are approaching a significant catastrophe of massive unemployment coupled with an equally enormous lack of jobs to employ those who have been displaced. In addition, the rate of change not only means that most people who are now in school will find their education wasn’t adequate for the available jobs, but they will be unable to change their skill set fast enough to be competitive with AIs and robots.</p>
              
                <p>That doesn’t have to be the case. Using the outline from the Manhattan 2 project coupled with the game-based training of Level Ex, not only can we create plans and opportunities that mitigate this employment risk, but we can also make people far more competitive with AIs, significantly reducing the chance they will be unemployable while translating the tedium of training to the fun of gaming.</p>
                

              
              <p>We can have a better future. We just have to make that a priority. Tools like those from FutureLab and Level Ex will help make that better future possible.</p>
