              <p>Well, it’s that time again when our students are undoubtedly hoping that they’re reading the calendar wrong and still have months of vacation left, only to find they’re on a deadline to provision themselves for the coming year.</p>
              <p>This world is vastly different than it was when I went to school. There are greater concerns about safety, more prominent and scarier risks of substance abuse (fentanyl was not a thing when I was in school), and the potential for bad choices I never had to make.</p>
              <p>For instance, when I was a kid, calculators were new on the scene, and using them for mathematics was considered cheating. Today, generative AI like ChatGPT is thought to be cheating — replacing services that would sell papers you could plagiarize as the preferred method to avoid doing schoolwork.</p>
            </span>

          <div class="v2101_22020">
            <span class="v2101_22021">ChatGPT</span>
            <p class="v2101_22022">
              <p>I mentioned that using generative AI could be seen as cheating, but the skills needed to use this tool, much like my old calculator, will be critical when young people reach the workforce. Still, without adult oversight, kids could use this tool for all the wrong reasons.</p>
              <p>You can help them get the productivity aspects of using the tool while still requiring them to do the work. Cutting down the time it takes to do the related research is a valuable skill they will need, but letting the tool do all the work will prevent them from learning and should be discouraged. If you are paying for the tool, you can monitor its use. If they use it behind your back, you’ll have no control whatsoever.</p>

            <span class="v2101_22024">Computer</span>
            <span class="v2101_22025">
              <p>When choosing a PC for your child, you want to start with the school. Find out if your child’s school will supply the PC — some do. If they don’t, what is the predominant PC at the school? Ask about the operating systems (Windows, ChromeOS, macOS) and the manufacturer.</p>
              <p>For instance, if the school uses mostly Dell computers, then a Dell PC would likely give your child the least aggravation and the best path to assistance if they have a problem. School staff will know the Dell machines and probably have a support line they can call for help tied to their contract with the company.</p>
              <p>Most students will want laptops. The basic clamshell design will work best with at least a 14-inch screen and six hours of battery life because electrical outlets are less prevalent than desks.</p>

            <span class="v2101_22032">
              <p>Kids lose things, but you don’t want them to lose a laptop, tablet, smartphone, or anything else valuable. The best tracker I’ve found so far is the Pebblebee. It is best because it is rechargeable; it lasts 12 months on a charge and can work with Android natively, giving it better coverage than most of its peers.</p>
              <p>You can attach a tracker to an expensive device you provide your child to help ensure it can be recovered if it is misplaced or stolen.</p>
              <p>You could have your child carry a tracker, as well, so that if they get lost, or something bad happens to them, you have a better chance of locating them. Chances are you will not need this, but knowing you could find them if they disappear could provide substantial peace of mind during the school year or any time.   </p>
